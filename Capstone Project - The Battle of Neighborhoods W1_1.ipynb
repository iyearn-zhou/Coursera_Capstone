Toronta has many neighborhoods with various places that attract tourists and people to visit. It is important to evaluate different neighborhoods based on the factors that are important for running a restaurant such as the number of competitors and the potential demand in that neighborhood. Costs for renting or buying a property play an important role .\n##### This project will help people to find the best neighborhood in Toronto to open an Chinese restaurant. The challenge is to find a suitable neighborhood which is easy to access, has fewer competitors, and of course is affordable to rent. A good place would be that many people will visit such as near a school,cinema, park, garden, and living area. \n"
